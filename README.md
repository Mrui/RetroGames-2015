# RetroGames-2015

This is a small project for our EESTEC event in Tampere.
Aim of this project is to create Arduino shield with Nokia 5110 screen, 4 push buttons and an analog joystick to use as a DYI hand held gaming console.

In this repository you can find the schema for the controller shield with Eagle files and some example codes done with Arduino IDE. Code works also with Intel Galileo systems (tho the games are a lot slower on Galileo because of it's software restictions). The demos are not fully functional games as we gave these codes to our participants and it was their job to make them actually playable. In all essence our event was an actual game jam with 4 days to code the simple game.

Most of the demo codes use or are based on SparkFun's Graphic LCD code by Jim Lindblom.
